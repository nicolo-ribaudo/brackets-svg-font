# THIS EXTENSION IS NO LONGER MANTAINED

I don't use [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) anymore, so I'm not maintaining this extension. If you would like to maintain it, contact me at nicolo.ribaudo@gmail.com.

# Brackets Font

An [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension that displays Svg, TrueType, OpenType and WOFF Fonts.

## Dependencies
In order to view TrueType, OpenType and WOFF fonts, you need to install [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io).

Be sure it is available from the command line. On Windows it should be enought to run `C:/Program Files (x86)/FontForgeBuilds/fontforge-console.bat`

## Usage
You don't have to do anything!
Just open the file and, if it is a font, it will be displayed like this:
